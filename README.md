# Node-Blog-CRUD
Express-Blog-App


This code represents the implementation of a web server using Node.js and Express for a simple blog system. It allows basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for blog entries, including support for images. Additionally, it utilizes the EJS template engine to dynamically generate the blog views.

The web application includes routes to view all entries, add new entries, edit and delete existing entries, as well as view specific details of an entry. The Multer middleware is used to handle the uploading of images associated with each entry. The code is modularly structured and follows Express conventions for route and view handling.

This project provides a practical introduction to essential web development concepts with Node.js and Express and can serve as a starting point for more complex projects or for learning about web application development with JavaScript.
